# Two Pointers
### Real-World Problems 
#### Memory management
 Two pointers are vital in memory allocation and deallocation. The memory pool is initialized with two pointers: the start pointer, pointing to the beginning of the available memory block, and the end pointer, indicating the end of the block. When a process or data structure requests memory allocation, the start pointer is moved forward, designating a new memory block for allocation. Conversely, when memory is released (deallocated), the start pointer is shifted backward, marking the deallocated memory as available for future allocations.

#### Product Suggestions
 While shopping online, when customers view their cart and the current total doesnâ€™t qualify for free shipping, we want to show them pairs of products that can be bought together to make the total amount equal to the amount required to be eligible for free delivery. Two pointers can be used to suggest the pairs that add up to the required cost for free shipping.
